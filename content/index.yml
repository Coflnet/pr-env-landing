  title: Frequently asked questions
  description: We have not received any questions yet, but here are some we made up
  items:
    - label: What type of applications are supported
      content: |
        At the moment we only support stateless applications with at least one HTTP endpoint.
        So we mainly target web applications (React, Vue, Next, Nuxt, etc.)
        But you can also use it for APIs or other types of applications that have an HTTP endpoint.
        The second requirement is that your application is deployed using Docker.
        We are working on adding support for stateful applications as well, but it's not ready yet.
      defaultOpen: true
    - label: What Git providers are supported?
      content: |
        We only support Github at the moment, but our roadmap includes support for Gitlab as well.
        If you need support for other Git providers, please let us know.
    - label: What container registries are supported?
      content: We use kaniko to build the Docker images, so any container registry that supports the Docker registry API should work.
    - label: How do I connect my repositories?
      content: |
        If you use our hosted version, you can connect your repositories in a easy to use UI.
        So you don't have to worry about setting up webhooks or anything like that.
        If you use the self-hosted version, you have to set up a webhook in your repository that points to the webhook endpoint of our service.
        We are doing our best to make this as easy as possible, but it's still a bit of manual work.
    - label: Do you offer support?
      content: |
        We don't have a support team, since no one has asked for support yet.
        But if you are ready to pay us, we can offer you support.
        We do have some b2b projects where we already offer a 24/7 support with help center and everything.
        You can get this as well, but it does cost a bit.
    - label: What is Coflnet?
      content: |
        Coflnet is the company behind this service.
        We do other public services as well, check out https://sky.coflnet.com for our Skyblock application.
        We also do some b2b projects, but we can't talk about them.
